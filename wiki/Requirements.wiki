#summary What one needs to build/run AjaxLife

= Server Dependencies =

To use !AjaxLife you must include the standard .NET System and System.Web assemblies. Furthermore, you must also include:
  * [http://www.codeproject.com/csharp/minihttpd.asp MiniHttpd] - small web-server library
  * [http://www.newtonsoft.com/products/json/ Newtonsoft Json.NET] - JSON encoding/decoding
  * [http://libsecondlife.org libsecondlife] - Library for communicating with SL.
  * [http://imagemagick.org/script/index.php ImageMagick] compiled with JPEG2000 support - needed for downloading textures.

The first three are included in the binary downloads.

= Client Dependencies =

There is a small requirement for PHP and GD for the sim down overlays - see images/simdownoverlay.php. This is mostly because I couldn't be bothered to make multiple sizes of translucent red image.

Everything the client needs is included with it. Note, however, that it expects to find itself in /ajaxlife/, on the same domain/port as the server. Change the STATIC_ROOT constant in !AjaxLife.!AjaxLife (Main.cs) to point it elsewhere. Since the !AjaxLife server is not set up to serve the static content, you'll probably want to do this.
